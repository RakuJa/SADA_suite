## Code of Conduct
------------------
If would like to contribute to our project and contribute to our work, please follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RakuJa/SADA_suite/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). 
## Pull Requests
----------------
Please, follow these basic rules when creating pull requests. Pull requests:
* Should:
  * Be tidy
  * Easy to read
  * Have optimized imports
  * Contain a sufficient amount of comments, if this is a new feature
* Should not:
  * Change the existing formatting of code, unless this is really required, especially of files that have no other changes, or are not related to the pull request at all. (Please, don't enable pre-commit features in IDE-s such as "Reformat code", "Re-arrange code" and so on, as this may add extra noise to the pull and make the diff harder to read. When adding, or changing code, apply the re-formatting, only to the respective changed code blocks).
  * Have unresolved merge conflicts with the base branch
  * Contain unaddressed **critical** issues
  * Have commented out dead code. (Commented out code is fine, just not blocks and blocks of it).
